# Abstract for the papers
abstract: The ability to quickly understand our physical environment and make predictions about interacting objects is fundamental to us humans. To equip artificial agents with similar reasoning capabilities, machine learning can be used to approximate the underlying state dynamics of a system. In this regard, deep learning has gained much popularity but is relying on the availability of large-enough datasets. In this work, we present DLO@Scale, a new dataset for studying future state prediction in the context of multi-body deformable linear object pushing. It contains a large collection of 100 million simulated interactions enabling thorough statistical analysis and algorithmic benchmarks. Our data is generated using a high-fidelity physics engine which simulates complex mechanical phenomena such as elasticity, plastic deformation and friction. An important aspect is the large variation of the physical parameters making it suitable for testing meta learning algorithms. We describe DLO@Scale and present a first empirical evaluation using neural network baselines.
