Nils Thuerey is an Associate Professor at Technical University of Munich (TUM). He works in the field of computer graphics, with a particular emphasis on physically-based animation. One focus area of his research targets the simulation of fluid phenomena, such as water and smoke. These simulations find applications as visual effects in computer generated movies and digital games. Examples of his work are novel algorithms to make simulations easier to control, to handle detailed surface tension effects, and to increase the amount of turbulent detail. After studying computer science, Nils Thuerey acquired a PhD for his work on liquid simulations in 2006. He received both degrees from the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg. Until 2010 he held a position as a post-doctoral researcher at ETH Zurich. He received a tech-Oscar from the AMPAS in 2013 for his research on controllable smoke effects. Subsequently, he worked for three years as R&D lead at ScanlineVFX, before he started at TUM in October 2013.
